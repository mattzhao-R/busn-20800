2020-02-21 01:44:28 EET,"@PPathole @JohnHanzl It‚Äôs mostly to balance the ship during entry. After delivering satellites, the front is light &amp; back is heavy due to engines &amp; landing legs."

2020-01-11 01:24:10 EET,"@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4."
2020-01-11 01:20:50 EET,@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps &amp; pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls

We‚Äôve only one car factory in California &amp; one Gigafactory (for batteries &amp; drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries &amp; drive units for the greater China area.

2016-05-28 04:49:43 EEST,"@dfjsteve Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard."
2016-05-28 01:51:08 EEST,Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
2016-05-28 01:16:59 EEST,"Rocket landing speed was close to design max &amp; used up contingency crush core, hence back &amp; forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping."

2016-05-01 08:56:57 EEST,Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
2016-05-01 08:52:56 EEST,F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
2016-05-01 04:10:35 EEST,"@elonmusk F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be 22,800 kg"

2016-05-01 02:56:19 EEST,@lukealization No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
2016-05-01 02:52:55 EEST,@elonmusk Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.

2016-04-04 01:17:18 EEST,@GatorWass you can do that now with S and X. Will be same for 3.
2016-04-04 01:16:41 EEST,@_elombardo @rjpryan correct
2016-04-04 01:16:06 EEST,@EduardoForneck hopefully 0.21
2016-04-04 01:13:55 EEST,@PeteEhmKay @gerardomarina what's the link to that?
2016-04-04 01:12:45 EEST,"@tapwin No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity."
2016-04-04 01:10:23 EEST,@mpatfield no problem
2016-04-04 01:08:10 EEST,@CrackedUpCorson Will cover whole country hopefully this year
2016-04-04 01:04:35 EEST,"@AndersRytter yes, but production AWD will be a lot faster"
2016-04-04 01:02:57 EEST,@AlexBelohlavek less
2016-04-04 01:02:16 EEST,@torvos torque is shifted between front &amp; rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog.
2016-04-04 00:55:13 EEST,"And, of course, it will have more cowbells."
2016-04-04 00:52:46 EEST,"Model 3 will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain."
2016-04-04 00:47:19 EEST,@GolfsHard yes
2016-04-04 00:47:04 EEST,@Zooropa88 @TeslaMotors Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year
2016-04-04 00:44:58 EEST,@_Only_Hawk @MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter definitely
2016-04-04 00:42:49 EEST,@Alandbru @TeslaMotors should be addressed this year
2016-04-03 23:57:38 EEST,@CmaxVs Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
2016-04-03 23:54:35 EEST,@iKrivetko that's not the real steering system
2016-04-03 23:52:05 EEST,@B_Rans yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
2016-04-03 23:51:25 EEST,@gerardomarina Some tweaking underway
2016-04-03 23:49:44 EEST,@HBL_Cosmin Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. It feels like a spaceship.
2016-04-03 22:52:30 EEST,@MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
2016-04-03 22:50:07 EEST,@scottkelley99 Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
2016-04-03 22:46:27 EEST,@_amwolo_ They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
2016-04-03 22:45:39 EEST,@BValvsRacing It will make sense after part 2 of the Model 3 unveil
2016-04-03 22:44:35 EEST,"A Model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally."

2016-04-03 22:27:15 EEST,@SnoozeThroughF1 There will be an optional tow hitch.
2016-04-03 22:11:15 EEST,@RGspan Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.
2016-04-03 21:59:58 EEST,@jeffrey @neutyp Matte black was surprisingly popular. Probably makes sense to bring it to production.
